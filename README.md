Gets waypoints and converts it to a readable format for minimap mods

## Usage

The jar is a program for getting the waypoints.

Please do *not* even try using this. It's a hacky mess that I made to work. There is some code written by me and some of it is a library (tesseract). 

You can still look at my code and assess the quality and knowledge. Almost every aspect is documented.
